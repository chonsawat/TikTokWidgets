A Node.js project to receive and decode livestream events such as subscribes and follows and display them as stream widgets in real-time from TikTok's LIVE service by connecting to TikTok's internal WebCast push service. 

This project is a Javascript tool  based off of
[TikTok-Live-Connector](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Live-Connector)
by [@zerodytrash](https://github.com/zerodytrash/) meant to serve as a free, open source tool for streamers on the platform.

This is **not** an official product. It is a research project & tinkering tool for streamers.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system
3. Clone this repository or download and extract [this ZIP file](https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokGiftWidget/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
4. Open a console/terminal in the root directory of the project
